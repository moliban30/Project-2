# Project-2
Random name generator
This is another project that I was able to create and it is random name generator is a program that selects a random name 
from a list of names. In this instance I used a combination of colors and names and created variables to store them.
After doing so I used a while loop incrementing only from 0 to 5 so that the loop continues until the variables have valid values.
Finally the functions return a string that concatenates the color element with the name element.
