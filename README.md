Random name generator
This is a random name generator. A program that selects a random name from a list of names. 
It uses a combination of colors and names that are stored in different variables.
It uses a while loop incrementing only from 0 to 5 so that the loop continues until the variables have valid values.
Finally the functions return a string that concatenates the color element with the name element. 
Using the loops the program creates a recurring situation where the user would have to pick a number between 0 and 5 in order to activate the variables controlling the loop thus generating their random name.
